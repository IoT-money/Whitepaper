# Section 2: Key Properties and Mechanisms

Asynchronous Sharding Model

> The asynchronous sharding model is fundamental to the scalability of the $$SMT$$ protocol. It allows for transactions to be processed independently across various shards, thereby enhancing the system's capacity to handle a larger volume of transactions concurrently.

* **Mathematical Representation**:

The entire network is represented as a union of its constituent shards:

$$
\text{Network} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} S_i
$$

$$\text{Each shard, denoted as} (Si)$$operates independently, contributing to the overall throughput of the system, which is the cumulative throughput of all shards:

$$
\Theta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta(S_i)
$$

Here,  $$\theta(S_i)$$ is the throughput of each individual shard  $$S_i, \text{ and } \Theta$$ is the total system throughput.

#### Client-Side Ordinal Transaction Ordering

> Ensuring a consistent sequence of transactions across the network is crucial for the integrity of the blockchain. The $$SMT$$ protocol addresses this through client-side ordinal transaction ordering.

* **Ordering Algorithm**:

Transactions are ordered using a cryptographic hash function that combines local rank and consensus data:

$$
\text{Ordinal Rank}(t) = \text{Hash}(\text{Local Rank}(t) \, || \, \text{Consensus Data}(t))
$$

In this formulation, $$||$$ denotes concatenation, ensuring that each transaction is assigned a unique and consistent global rank.

#### Triadic Consensus Mechanism

> The triadic consensus mechanism is a novel approach designed to improve fault tolerance and efficiency in reaching consensus.

* **Consensus Process**:

The mechanism operates on the principle of triadic agreement:

$$
\text{Consensus}(T) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if majority in a triad agrees on } T \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

This method ensures efficient consensus even in scenarios where some nodes may be faulty or unresponsive.

#### Sierpinski Merkle Trie Structure

> The Sierpinski Merkle Trie $$(SMT)$$ structure plays a pivotal role in the protocol, particularly in efficient transaction proof generation and verification.

* **Structural Definition**:

The $$SMT$$ is defined recursively, combining the benefits of a Merkle Trie with the geometric properties of the Sierpinski gasket:

$$
\text{SMT}(x) = \begin{cases} H(x) & \text{if } x \text{ is a leaf node} \\ H(\text{SMT}(C_1), \ldots, \text{SMT}(C_k)) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

Here, $$C_i$$ represents child nodes, and $$H$$ is a cryptographic hash function. This design facilitates both efficient transaction proof generation and secure verification.

**Remarks**

This section significantly expands on the key properties and mechanisms of the $$SMT$$ protocol, providing a deeper understanding through mathematical formalisms and concise explanations. The integration of asynchronous sharding, client-side ordinal transaction ordering, triadic consensus, and the $$SMT$$ structure illustrates the protocol's comprehensive approach to achieving scalability, security, and efficiency in blockchain systems. The detailed exposition of these concepts, underpinned by mathematical rigor, aligns with the high standards expected in scholarly research and positions the protocol as a sophisticated solution for decentralized architectures.\

#### SMT Algorithm

> The Sierpinski Merkle Trie $$(SMT)$$ enables efficient transaction ordering and verification. Key properties include:

* Recursive construction mirroring triadic topology
* Accumulation of hashes enabling Merkle proofs
* Bottom-up consensus aggregation

**Definition**: The $$SMT$$ is defined recursively as:

$$
[ SMT(T) = \begin{cases} \text{hash}(T) & \text{if } T \text{ is a leaf triad}\\\\ H(SMT(C_1), \dotsc, SMT(C_k)) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} ]
$$

Where $$( C_i )$$ are the child triads of $$( T )$$ and $$( H() )$$ aggregates hashes. \
\
**Theorem:** \
The $$SMT$$ structure enables $$( O(\log n) )$$ validation of transactions using Merkle proofs, where $$(n)$$ is the number of transactions.\
\
_**Proof**_**:** \
Follows from the Merkle proof verification complexity being $$(O(log N))$$ for an $$(n)-leaf tree$$.Thus, the $$SMT$$ provides an efficient cryptographic accumulator suited to the triadic topology.\
